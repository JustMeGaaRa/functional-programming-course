# Introduction

A few words about this course.

## Why?

I believe that learning new paradigms and new practices makes us better programmers. Nowdays there are armies of developers who use OOP in everyday life.They fight the immperative dragon with factories and strategies, inheritance and polymorphism until they burn themselves with tight coupling and boilerplate code.
Functional is here to help and change the perspective.

## How?

Each paradigm has its own principles, pillars on which it stands. This course is will introduce those principles with examples in C#, F# and TypeScript. Some of those languages are imperative-first (like C# and TypeScript), some are functional-first (like F#). This should be a great way to introduce functional concepts in a language that people have been working with for some timme. Moreover, comparing the code side by side will help to unnderstand the implementation in other languages.

## What?

As the result of this course you should be able to unnderstand the common concepts and principles of functional programming, use it to be more productive. You will be able to write more error prone code and benefit from features like type inference and functional data types.
