The thing is that partial apllication is used on function's last parameter and produces another function which can be used later on. If we compare two versions, then we will see that the one with closure holds a reference and function `mutiply` cannot be changed ever again. It now holds a reference to variable `multiplier` which is bound to value 5. No way to change it. The version with partial application produced a new function with it's own name called `multiplyBy5`, but the original `multiply` has not changed. This is a very neat and flexible way to reuse the functions."
