    "The world of programming is a complex world nowerdays. There is so many libraries, so many frameworks, so many thinngs to program against. This requires a way to deal with all this complexity that's piled up in each and every ptojecct over the years. Now, we need to support those project for couplle of years, even tens of years afterwards, right? And we want not to just deal with legacy code, but to actually have it up to date, have it clean and easy to understand.\n",

    "In functional programming we deal with complexity by combining little pieces toghether. Those pieces are actually functions. And we want them to be simple, decoupled and easy to undnerstand, so that we have a set of building blocks which can be used and combined in different ways. Like when we're building a house with bricks - small building blocks that help us to create all those different and unique houses that suit our needs."
