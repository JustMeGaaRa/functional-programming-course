    "The world of programming is a complex thing nowadays. There is so many libraries, so many frameworks, so many practices and implementations. This requires a way to deal with all this complexity that's piled up in each and every ptoject over the years. Now, we need to support those project for at least couple of years, even tens of years afterwards, right? And we want not to just deal with legacy code, but to actually have it up to date, have it clean and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP-way of dealing with complexity is to encapsulate the details, extend with polymorhism, and reuse with inheritance. Lately, sbstraction was introduced to the family. Each of those approaches is not perfect and has it's own flaws. Tough encapsulation hides the unnecessary  implementation details, they still require a hard reference to the dependencies. Polymorphism is usually tighed up with inheritance and gets very complex when trying to build inherit more then one type (the diamond problem) and is not very explicit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition rather than inheritance from a base or parent class. This is an often-stated principle of OOP, such as in the influential book Design Patterns. Abstraction actually helps, but now we have tons and tons of interfaces (or any other type of sbsract definitions). For further reading I suggest a blog post on Medium called [\"Object-Oriented Programming â€” The Trillion Dollar Disaster\"](https://medium.com/better-programming/object-oriented-programming-the-trillion-dollar-disaster-92a4b666c7c7) by Ilya Suzdalnitski.\n",

    "In functional programming we deal with complexity by combining little pieces toghether. Those pieces are actually functions. And we want them to be simple, decoupled and easy to undnerstand. This way we have a set of building blocks which can be used and combined in different ways. Like when we're building a house with bricks - small building blocks that help us to create all those different and unique houses that suit our needs. Functional languages usually support somme features that make you write less boilerplate code. But this does not mean you should not use OOP or othe languages. You can easily write functional code using most of the modern languages."
